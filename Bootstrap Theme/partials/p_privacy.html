        consumer (such as survey information and/or site registrations). The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web pages and the quality of our service, and 
        is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the

        It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats 
        to the physical safety of any person, violations of Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law. We transfer information about you if 'The Business Entity' is acquired 
        by or merged with another entity. In this event, 'The Business Entity' will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
