Welcome to Bodeo

This theme and site template was created with simplicity, integration and
customization in mind. The simplest way to get started is to copy (upload or deploy) the contents (files and folders) of the `/blank` folder to the root
folder of the Web site on the Web server. This will get you started with a minimal Website instance.

For more information, see the docs.html page located in the same folder as this README.
