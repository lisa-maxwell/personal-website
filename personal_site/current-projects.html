    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-light">#loveyourSELFIE structured educational group founder (2018): <br><br>One of my biggest concerns for the students I worked with in the public school system is their lack of exposure to career counseling-- especially in STEM related careers.  I developed and began a structured counseling group for 5th grade girls with the program goals of developing confidence and mentorship in exploring careers in STEM.  The program, entitled #loveyourSELFIE, provides a safe environment for female students to develop essential soft skills and have direct contact with local female tech leaders for mentorship.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-light">"Virtual Fieldtrip" Title I school summer camp (2019): <br><br>Parents became interested in more STEM exposure for their students after the first offering of the #loveyourSELFIE counseling group.  In response, I partnered with a CMS Title I summer camp director to develop the cirrculum for the "Virtual Summer Camp" experience for any 3rd-5th student enrolled in summer camp for the 2019 year.  Students create using basic HTML and CSS and explore logic with Dash and Dot.</li>
